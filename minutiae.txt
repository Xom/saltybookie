I've made quite a few manual edits to matches.all.csv, and here I'll try to
mention as many of those edits as I can remember, but be warned, I probably
won't get them all.

For some of the mirror matches, I couldn't be bothered to discover which of
the numbers I had was winnerbet and which was loserbet, so I flipped a coin.

_old_ is for buffs, nerfs, and removed dupes (some Ash dupes were removed
in September).  _aug_ is for names with dupes added in September.

I'm uncertain whether Zeroko beat Marisa kirisame under AI or human control.

Some names were inconsistently capitalized, due to being typed in by Salty
for exhibition matches; other than occasionally being easier to distinguish
an exhibition match, lowercasing all data didn't destroy any info.

Some names had a space at the end, which I've stripped, except for 'Kyo'
and 'Kyo ', which I've renamed to _fake_kyo and _real_kyo, respectively.

It seemed likely enough that Marisa (in old matches i.e. not the new
Marisa) and Marisa kirisame are the same character for me to edit the
former to the latter, even though I'm still not completely certain.
