SaltyBookie v4.0

https://github.com/Xomnom/saltybookie

SaltyBookie calculates ratings for SaltyBet ( http://saltybet.com )
characters using logistic regression.  saltybookie.r is a R script and
requires R libraries 'Matrix' and 'glmnet'.  saltybookie.pl is a XChat
plugin and requires Perl modules Text::CSV and String::Approx.

Type 'make' to generate ratings.  For convenience, this repository also
includes a pre-generated ratings.noheader.csv, which is the input file
to saltybookie.pl.

matches.all.csv 'exclude' column legend:
0 = not excluded
1 = mirror match
2 = non-1v1
3 = autobalance
4 = double-record error
5 = uncertain whether _old_
6 = other
7 = temporary

A linear increase in the difference between two characters' ratings implies
an exponential increase in one characters's odds of beating the other.  In
theory each 1-pt. difference equates to a e:1 odds factor (see equation).

P(win_red) = 1 / (1 + e^(rating_blue - rating_red))

However, because it doesn't (yet) calibrate variance on a per-character
basis, SaltyBookie currently overestimates the probability of upset for a
majority of matchups and underestimates it for a minority.

      2013-8-17:    Logistic regression using glm(); run duration: 30-40 min.
v0,   2013-8-19:    Logistic regression using glmnet; run duration: ~1 sec.

v1.0, 2013-8-24:    Xom_bot outputs statblocks for individual characters!
v1.2, 2013-8-24:    Xom_bot now has cooldowns per unique response.
v1.3, 2013-8-24:    Xom_bot now fuzzy-matches names!
v1.4, 2013-8-24:    Xom_bot now autocorrects when exactly one fuzzy-match.

v2.1, 2013-8-24:    Xom_bot now outputs predicted probabilities!
v2.2, 2013-8-24:    Xom_bot now responds to SaltyGoku commands.
v2.5, 2013-8-25:    Xom_bot now responds to Possessed_Hanny commands.
v2.6, 2013-8-27:    Fix Xom_bot crash when too many fuzzy-match results.

v3.0, 2013-8-27:    Overconfident no more!  SaltyBookie now uses a
                      normal-distribution prior (i.e. ridge regression)
                      at a prior strength chosen with cross-validation.
                      Previously, it used (due to my ignorance) a
                      Laplacian prior at minimum strength.
v3.1, 2013-8-27:    Xom_bot in color!
v3.2, 2013-8-29:    Restructure match history CSV.
v3.3, 2013-9-2:     Prefix pre-buff/nerf characters with _old_.
v3.4, 2013-9-16:    Exclude autobalance matches.
v3.5, 2013-9-18:    Xom_bot now responds to Peppermill output.

v4.0, 2013-9-24:    Add documentation and license.  Automate data
                      processing pipeline with Makefile.  Re-restructure
                      match history CSV.  Put on GitHub.

TODO:
> Calibrate variance on a per-character basis.
> For names with dupes added in Sep., prefix with _aug_ in previous matches.
> Then undo the temporary exclusion on post-September-update matches.
